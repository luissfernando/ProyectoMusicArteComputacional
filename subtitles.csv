93,96,Here our soldiers stand  
96,98,From all around the world
98,100,Waiting in a line
100,104,To hear the battle cry
104,106,All are gathered here
106,109,Victory is near
108,112,The sound will fill the hall
112,114,Bringing power to us all
114,117,We alone are fighting
117,120,For metal, that is true
120,123,We own the right, to live the fight
123,125,We're here for all of you
125,129,Now swear the blood upon your steel
129,131,Will never dry
131,134,Stand and fight together
134,138,Beneath the metal sky
138,140,Brothers everywhere
140,142,Raise your hands into the air
142,147,We're warriors, warriors of the world
148,151,Like thunder from the sky
151,154,Sworn to fight and die
154,158,We're warriors, warriors of the world
160,164,Many stand against us, but they will never win
165,167,We said we would return
167,170,And here we are again
170,172,To bring them all destruction
172,175,Suffering, and pain
175,178,We are the hammer of the Gods
178,181,We are thunder, wind, and rain
181,183,There they wait in fear
183,186,With swords in feeble hands
186,189,With dreams to be a king
189,191,First, one should be a man
191,195,I call about and charge them all
195,197,With a life that is a lie
197,204,And in their final hour, they shall confess before they die
205,207, Brothers everywhere
207,208,Raise your hands into the air
208,213,We're warriors, warriors of the world
215,218,Like thunder from the sky
218,220,Sworn to fight and die
220,225,We're warriors, warriors of the world
227,230,If I should fall in battle
230,235,My brothers who fight by my side
236,240,Gather my horse, and weapons
240,246,Tell my family how I died
247,250,Until then I will be strong
251,256,I will fight for all that is real
257,264,All who stand in my way, will die by steel
265,267,Brothers everywhere
268,270,Raise your hands into the air
271,274,We're warriors, warriors of the world
276,279,Brothers everywhere
280,281,Raise your hands into the air
282,285,We're warriors, warriors of the world
